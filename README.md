# Getting Started with Groupomania front-end

You have to run [Groupomania backend](https://github.com/Lucasmomille/P7-groupomania-backend) too.


## Create an admin profile

You need to use Postman "/auth/signup"

In the body paste this :
{

    "firstname": "FIRSTNAME_OF_YOUR_ADMIN",

    "lastname": "lASTNAME_OF_YOUR_ADMIN"",

    "email": "EMAIL_OF_YOUR_ADMIN"",

    "password": "PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_ADMIN"",

    "roles":["admin"]

}

`Note that your password must contains uppercase, lowercase, symbole and number`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.



### A word about the UI

There was no layout for the project and it has to be accessible, so I took the most contrasted colors of the visual identity.
